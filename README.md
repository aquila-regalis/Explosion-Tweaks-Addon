# Explosion Tweaks Addon

This addon makes minor changes to explosions to make them feel a little more explode-y.
Nearby blocks will crack and loosen in a manner consistent with their neighbors being torn apart and blown to bits.
While this does make explosions slightly more damaging to terrain, it is mostly cosmetic and should have minimal gameplay implications.
(In particular, it does **not** allow creeper explosions to break third strata stone.
They can crack it, but won't break it even after multiple explosions.)

A couple examples of the aftermath of a TNT explosion:
